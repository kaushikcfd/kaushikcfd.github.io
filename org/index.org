I am a PhD student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I am a
part of the [[http://scicomp.cs.illinois.edu/][Scientific Computing group]] in the Computer Science Department. I am
working with [[https://andreask.cs.illinois.edu/][Prof. Andreas Kl√∂ckner]] on /Domain Specific Compilers/ for Numerical
Methods for PDEs.

Before starting out as a PhD Student, I was an undergraduate student at
Indian Institute of Technology at Bombay, where I worked on topics
related to Computational Fluid Dynamics.
