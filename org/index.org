I am a second year PhD student at University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, where I am a part of the
[[http://scicomp.cs.illinois.edu/][Scientific Computing group]] in the
Computer Science Department. I am advised by
[[https://andreask.cs.illinois.edu/][Prof. Andreas Kl√∂ckner]] with whom
I am working in the area of /Transformation based Code Generation/ in
applications motivated by Finite element methods.

Before starting out as a PhD Student, I was an undergraduate student at
Indian Institute of Technology at Bombay, where I worked on topics
related to Computational Fluid Dynamics.
